# Happy Box Application

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmbehroozfar/Happy-Box/develop/pictures/preview.gif" alt="Logo" align="right">
 
You can keep your happy things in this app.

Whenever you feel bad, just run the app and see one of your happy things randomly to cheer yourself up.

By default, it will add some items to the app. 

There are some general things like "Buy Pizza" that can help people to feel better. 

Also, you can add all your stuff and use them.
